    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "What is the main advantage of predictive maintenance over preventive maintenance?",
      "options": [
        "It is cheaper in the short term.",
        "It uses AI and IoT to predict failures before they occur.",
        "It requires less data and computing power.",
        "It eliminates the need for regular check-ups."
      ],
      "correct_answer_index": 1,
      "explanation": "Predictive maintenance uses data, AI, and IoT devices to spot issues before they become real problems, unlike preventive maintenance which is scheduled and may miss early signs of trouble."
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "How does unsupervised learning contribute to predictive maintenance?",
      "options": [
        "It uses historical data to predict failures.",
        "It detects unusual patterns without predefined ideas of issues.",
        "It adjusts strategies in real time based on feedback.",
        "It monitors infrastructure for signs of weakness."
      ],
      "correct_answer_index": 1,
      "explanation": "Unsupervised learning helps detect unusual patterns that don’t match normal behavior, even without a predefined idea of what’s wrong, which is useful in predictive maintenance."

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Which of the following is NOT a benefit of preventive maintenance in public transport?",
      "options": [
        "Preventing service disruptions.",
        "Enhancing safety and reliability.",
        "Reducing maintenance costs.",
        "Eliminating the need for AI and ML."
      ],
      "correct_answer_index": 3,
      "explanation": "Preventive maintenance benefits include preventing service disruptions, enhancing safety, and reducing costs, but it does not eliminate the need for AI and ML, which are crucial for predictive maintenance."
