    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "What is a major advantage of shared mobility services in urban areas?",
      "options": [
        "Increased vehicle ownership",
        "Reduced congestion and parking space needs",
        "Higher emissions from vehicle production",
        "Decreased public transport usage"
      ],
      "correct_answer_index": 1,
      "explanation": "Shared mobility services reduce the number of vehicles on the road, which decreases congestion and the need for parking spaces."

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "How do AI-driven models improve demand forecasting in shared mobility?",
      "options": [
        "By using only historical data",
        "By ignoring real-time changes in travel behavior",
        "By leveraging vast amounts of data for precise predictions",
        "By focusing solely on single mode transport"
      ],
      "correct_answer_index": 2,
      "explanation": "AI-driven models use vast amounts of data to predict demand more precisely, learning from real-time changes in travel behavior."
