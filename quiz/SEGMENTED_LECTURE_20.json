      "question": "What is a primary disadvantage of traditional traffic control methods?",
      "options": [
        "They are too expensive to implement.",
        "They operate on pre-programmed schedules, failing to adapt to real-time conditions.",
        "They require constant manual adjustments.",
        "They are not compatible with modern vehicles."
      ],
      "correct_answer_index": 1,
      "explanation": "Traditional traffic control methods use fixed time signals that do not adapt to real-time traffic conditions, leading to inefficiencies."

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "How do smart traffic light systems prioritize emergency vehicles?",
      "options": [
        "By using AI to predict emergency routes.",
        "By automatically turning traffic lights green when an emergency vehicle approaches.",
        "By manually controlling traffic lights from a central center.",
        "By using drones to monitor traffic flow."
