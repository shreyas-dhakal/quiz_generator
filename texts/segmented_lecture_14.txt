Welcome to the module Data Sources in Urban Mobility. In this module, we’re going to explore how different types of data help us understand the way people move through cities and regions. We’ll look at how location data from mobile networks, smartphone applications, and transport systems can be used to study mobility patterns at scale. These insights are key to designing smarter and more connected transport systems. So let’s get started.

Since the early 2000s, there has been a major leap in how we understand human mobility. Thanks to new technologies that track where people go over time, researchers now have access to massive amounts of movement data. This has opened up new possibilities in studying how we move through our cities and beyond.

So where does all this data come from? Let’s break it down.

First, we have mobile network data.

Mobile operators collect location information as part of their everyday operations. Every time your phone connects to a cell tower, your general location is recorded. This is mainly for billing and to make sure the network runs smoothly. But it turns out to be incredibly useful for mobility research.

The accuracy of this data depends on how dense the network of cell towers is. In cities, the coverage area might be just a few dozen meters. In rural areas, it can be several kilometers. Over time, the way this data is recorded has improved. Earlier, we relied on Call Detail Records, which only captured location when someone made a call or sent a message. Now, we also have access to data from internet use and other network activity, which gives a more continuous view of how people move.

Now let’s talk about smartphone applications.

This is one of the richest sources of location data today. In the early days, platforms like Twitter gave us small windows into people's locations when they posted updates. But things have changed. Many apps now collect GPS data automatically. These include navigation tools, fitness apps, and even those used for shopping or advertising.

What makes this even more powerful is that many apps include special software that sends GPS data back to companies that manage this kind of information. These companies can collect location data across many different apps, building a very detailed picture of where people go and when. For researchers, this provides a unique opportunity to study mobility patterns with high precision.

Let’s move on to transport and sensor data.

With the digital transformation of transportation, we now have detailed data on how people use public and private transport systems. Public transit agencies track how travel cards are used across buses, subways, and trains. Entire taxi fleets can be monitored in real time. This allows researchers to study not just individual trips but also system wide movement across cities.

And then we have new mobility services. Think of car sharing, bike sharing, electric scooters, and ride hailing platforms. These services generate large volumes of detailed movement data that help us understand how people combine different modes of travel. Some vehicles are also equipped with sensors that collect information about traffic, weather, air quality, and even the behaviors and emotions of people in the urban environment.

Of course, working with this kind of data brings its own set of challenges.

Because most of this information was not collected with research in mind, it often includes gaps or inaccuracies. Some data might be noisy or incomplete. That is why careful cleaning, validation, and preprocessing are essential before starting any analysis. Even something that sounds simple, like figuring out where someone stops or where they live, can be quite complex in practice.

Still, despite these challenges, the variety and volume of mobility data available today offer incredible opportunities. For researchers, for planners, and for anyone interested in shaping the future of transportation, this is an exciting time. The more we understand how people move, the better we can design connected, efficient, and inclusive mobility systems for everyone.

In conclusion, understanding how different data sources, from mobile networks to smartphone apps and transport systems ,enable us to study human mobility at scale is essential for building smarter and more responsive cities.

I hope this session has provided you with valuable insights into how large scale movement data is transforming the way we study, plan, and improve mobility in our cities. Thank you for joining me, and I look forward to seeing you in the next lesson.
