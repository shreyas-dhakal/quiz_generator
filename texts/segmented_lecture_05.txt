Welcome to the module Climate Goals and the Role of Transportation. In this module, we’ll dive into the urgent challenge of greenhouse gas emissions, the European Union’s ambitious climate targets, and how transportation fits into the bigger picture. So let’s get started.

In recent years, the European Union has really ramped up its efforts to tackle greenhouse gas emissions and the growing threat of climate change. A major milestone came in 2019 with the launch of the European Green Deal, introduced by the European Commission to guide Europe toward a greener, more sustainable future.

Now, this isn’t just about vague promises or distant goals. The Green Deal lays out a clear roadmap to achieve climate neutrality by 2050. That means no net greenhouse gas emissions at all. Along the way, the European Union aims to cut net emissions by at least 55% by 2030, compared to 1990 levels.

Fast forward to July 2021, and these ambitions became law. The European Climate Law locked the Green Deal’s objectives into place, making them legally binding. That’s right, every European Union policy now has to align with the climate goals. It also introduced mechanisms to track progress and ensure that targets aren’t just set… but actually met.

And the ambition didn’t stop there. In February 2024, the European Commission proposed a new target, aiming for a massive 90% reduction in net greenhouse gas emissions by 2040. That’s a clear sign that the European Union isn’t just serious about climate leadership, it’s doubling down on it.

Let’s zoom out for a moment and look at the global picture.

In 2019, transportation was the second largest global contributor regarding greenhouse gas emissions. The only sector emitting more was electricity and heat production, which released nearly twice as much.

Back in Europe, the numbers tell an even more pressing story. As the European Union economy bounced back from the COVID 19 pandemic, transportation made up nearly a quarter of the region’s total greenhouse gas emissions. Road transport was the biggest offender: contributing over 75% of the transport sector’s emissions.

And if we break that down even further: passenger cars were responsible for the largest share, almost 59%. Heavy duty trucks and buses followed with 28%, then light duty trucks with nearly 12%, and finally, motorcycles and other vehicles made up just over 1%.

Here’s the most critical point: transportation is the only sector in the European Union whose emissions have consistently increased since 1990. While other sectors have managed to cut back, transport has been moving in the opposite direction.

This makes one thing crystal clear: if we’re serious about meeting the European Union’s climate targets, we need bold, innovative, and sustainable solutions for the transport sector.

In conclusion, understanding the link between climate goals and the transportation sector is key to addressing the environmental challenges we face today. Throughout this module, we looked at the European Union’s climate ambitions, starting with the European Green Deal, and how these goals are being solidified through legislation and increasingly ambitious emission reduction targets. We also explored the significant impact of transportation on greenhouse gas emissions, especially road transport, and why this sector remains a critical focus for innovation and change.

I hope this session has given you a solid foundation on the climate context surrounding transport and why transforming this sector is essential to achieving a greener future. Thanks for joining me, and I’ll see you in the next lesson.
