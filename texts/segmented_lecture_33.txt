Throughout this module, we’ve explored the main challenges and limitations facing AI driven mobility across technical, regulatory, and ethical dimensions.

We began with the first lesson, Technical Challenges and Limitations in AI for Mobility.
 In this lesson, we looked at key technical problems. These included poor data quality, cybersecurity risks, and the high cost of using AI.
 We also talked about the need for AI systems to be reliable and strong. They must also be able to grow and handle the demands of power and energy use.

Next came the second lesson, Regulatory and Privacy Issues in AI Driven Mobility.

We talked about the importance of protecting personal data. We also looked at tricky questions, like who is responsible when AI makes a mistake.

Finally, we had the third lesson, Ethical, Social, and Environmental Impacts of AI in Urban Mobility.

We explored problems like bias in algorithms, fair access to technology, and the effects of AI on jobs and the environment.

By understanding these multifaceted challenges, you’re better equipped to critically assess the challenges derived from AI integration and contribute to the development of responsible, equitable, and sustainable mobility solutions.

This marks the final module of the course. I hope you’ve enjoyed the journey and gained insights that will help you critically assess the future of urban mobility.
